Hear \nYe! The king (KING NAME) has put a 10,000 gold bounty on the head of the dragon that has \nbeen terrorizing (TOWN NAME 2). Any brave soul that finds themselves capable of the task is \nwelcome to attempt this feat. 500 gold will be given in order to pay for equipment.\"",

    "\n\nCourier: \“Excellent, Here is your gold. I would advise that you visit \nyour local shop and then depart immediately. Upon your arrival in (TOWN NAME 2) visit the \ncourier’s outpost near the town hall. Good luck.\” The courier rides off, leaving you to prepare for \nyour quest.",
    "\n\nCourier: \“It has been 2 fortnights since the dragon attacks started in (TOWN NAME 2). \nThe drake has made its nest on the (MOUNTAIN NAME) mountain just north of there. It is a \nperilous journey fraught with danger. Also several members of the nobility have gone missing \nand while I can’t offer you anything I’m sure they would reward you handsomely should you find \nand help them.\"",

    "\n\nDon’t lie to me, I saw you take that money out there. I just hope you know what you’re doing.",
    "\n\nNow, What do you need?",
    "\n\n\“Good luck! I hope I’ll see you in one piece again. Oh and visit that old bakery (BAKERY NAME) \nthat your father and I used to go to back when we were traveling, if it’s still standing that is.\”",
    "\n\nHaving decided that you are well enough equipped to handle the journey ahead, you set forth \nfor (TOWN NAME 2), in the hopes of finding the dragon or resupplying before your trip to its \nnest. You leave through the east gate of the town, leaving everything you know behind.\n\nA few hours into your journey you notice two wolves devouring some newly conquered prey, and \nwhile they won’t fight you unless provoked, you feel as though this may be a good chance to test \nyour skills.",

    "\n\nContinuing on your path you notice a cart that was run of the path and crashed into a tree. \nYou realize that the horse pulling this cart was most likely the victim of the two wolves you just \nencountered.",
    "\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Investigate the cart\n\t2: Continue on the path",

As you consider turning back, you notice several men have made \ncamp at the base of a large tree and you also notice that there is someone in the tree.\n\nUnsure of the situation you slowly approach the scene, attempting to remain undetected. \nYou hear one of the men on the ground shout \“Come on (NOBILITY NAME), it’s been hours \nand you have to come down eventually.\" You recognize the name to be a member of the nobility \nin the area and realize that the men below are armed and are most likely bandits.",

Thank you for your help. Here take this 150 Gold that I have with me. \nI’m sorry that I can’t offer you more. I overheard that bandits mention that the path to (TOWN \nNAME 2) is just over this hill. I wish you the best of luck.\n\n(NOBILITY NAME) departs down the path that you came from, on their way back to (TOWN NAME 1).\n\nFollowing the instructions given, you find your way back to the path and continue on your way.",
    "\n\nYou sneak past and over the hill that bordered the other side of the scene. Once on the other \nside you notice that the path to (TOWN NAME 2) is only a short distance away.",
    "\n\nAs you continue on your path you notice that it is getting dark and the sky looks as though it \nmay storm. You realize that you need to make camp soon.",
    "\n\nYou arrive at the base of a small mountain. There is a rock formation that could provide you \nshelter from the inclement weather and a clearing about about fifty yards further along the path.\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Make camp at the rock formation\n\t2: Make camp at the clearing",
    "\n\nYou decide to make camp at the rock formation. You notice a blackberry bush with enough \nberries to fulfill your appetite for the night. You gather firewood and start a fire, preparing for a \nstormy night.\n\nYou awake suddenly not sure at all where you are, a bad headache that you are fairly certain is \nfrom being clubbed over the head.\n\nBefore you can even get your balance, a horde of goblins engages you",
    "\n\nYou decide to continue to the clearing to make camp. There isn’t much available for food \nbut you manage to find some wild berries to sate your hunger. You gather firewood and start a \nfire, hoping that it won’t storm.\n\nIt begins to storm badly and you run back to the rock formation for shelter. However, upon running \nunder the rock, a trapdoor opens and you fall into a dungeon.\n\nYou manage to land on your feet but a horde of goblins quickly engage you.",
    "\n\nUpon defeating the wave of goblins, you realize that there may be more goblins than you can \nhandle.",

    "",
    "\n\nYou raise your hands to signal surrender and ask to speak to who’s in charge. Upon \nasking, a large goblin being carted in on a litter, is set down in front of you. The goblin king \naddresses you, \“I think this situation we can mend, if you’ll simply turn over your friend.\” You \nwonder who he’s talking about, and turning around you realize that you’ve actually been holding \noff the goblins from attacking the person hiding in the corner behind you. “They are our true foe, \nshould you comply, we’ll simply let you go.\”\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Accept the offer\n\t2: Negotiate for the release of the other person",
    "\n\nAccepting their offer, the goblins escort you out of the cave but you wonder about the fate \nof the other person.",
    "\n\n\“If it’s them you want to save, from what is surely a grave, then it only fits, that we \nhave a game of wits. Should you correctly answer two of my riddles three, then I will set both of \nyou free.\”\n\nAlbeit annoyed by the rhyming you accept the challenge.",
    "\n\nThe first riddle is given\n\“ It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,\nCannot be heard, cannot be smelt.\nIt lies behind stars and under hills,\nAnd empty holes it fills.\nIt comes first and follows after,\nEnds life, kills laughter\”\n\nOne word answer: ",
    "\n\nThe second riddle is given\n\“A box without hinges, key or lid,\nYet golden treasure inside is hid\”\n\nOne word answer: ",
    "\n\nThe third riddle is given\n\“This thing all things devours:\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers;\nGnaws iron, bites steel;\nGrinds hard stones to meal;\nSlays king, ruins town,\nAnd beats high mountain down.\”\n\nOne word answer: ",
    "\n\nNot enough correct: \“Alas, you could not could not correctly answer two of my riddles three, \nso it is only you that shall go free.\” The goblins escort you from the cave and you try to focus on \nthe task at hand rather than think of the fate of the other person.",
    "\n\nEnough correct: \“You are truly wise, for of the riddles i could devise, they could not best you, \nand for this stranger you came through. Leave this place now, my servants will show you how.\” \nThe goblins escort you and the stranger outside of the cave and then go back inside.",
    "\n\nYou ask the stranger and they reply (NOBILITY NAME). You recognize the name to be one \nof the members of the nobility. \“Thank you so much for your help. I surely would have been \nkilled had you not been there. I had escaped their prison but could not find the way out, I’ve \nbeen hiding for days in that cave. Here take this health potion that I found while I was hiding. I \nhope I can thank you more properly someday. (ADD POTION) I can find my way back to town, I \ndon’t want to inconvenience you anymore than I already have.\” The person then walks away as \nyou focus on your original quest.",
    "\n\nHappy to have rid yourself of the goblins, you still have to figure out how to get back to the \npath. You notice a large cart moving at the base of the mountain. You notice that it is a merchant \ncart and think that you can probably buy equipment from them and ask for directions.\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Approach the cart\n\t2: Climb the mountain in hopes of seeing the path over the trees ",
    "\n\nYou climb up the mountain and watch the cart fade into the distance. You can see for miles \nin all directions and you locate the path, a few hundred yards to the north of your location. You \nmake your way down the mountain and head toward the path. After several hours of travel you \nmake it to (TOWN NAME 2).",
    "\n\nYou approach the cart and notice that the driver has an amulet on that you recognize as \nthe amulet that most nobility is given by the king.As you approach the driver greets you. \“Hello \ntraveler! Are you interested in buying some of my wares?\”",
    "\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Buy items\n\t2: Ask for directions\n\t3:Investigate the inside of the cart\n\t4.Inquire about the amulet",
    "\n\nThe driver seems taken back by the question and struggles to answer. \“It was a… gift… \nfrom my grandfather. It’s been passed down for generations.\” The driver glances to the back of \nthe cart which makes you suspicious.",
    "\n\n\“I’m heading to (TOWN NAME 2) as well, you can ride the rest of the way with me. Climb \non board and we’ll be off\”",
    "\n\nAfter a few hours of riding you arrive at (TOWN NAME 2). \“Well, here we are. The \nride was a pleasure. You don’t owe me anything for the ride but I will ask again if you’d like to \npurchase any of my wares.\”\n\t1: Shop\n\t2: Continue",
    "\n\nYou make your way to the back of the cart and before the driver can stop you, you notice a \nsack that seems to be moving. Before you can search the back you feel the cold steel of a \ndagger piercing your back. You turn to face your assailant and realize that the \ncarriage driver is your foe.",
    "\n\nAfter defeating the carriage driver you hear a thump as the aforementioned \nsack rolls of the cart and onto the ground. You walk over to untie the sack and no sooner than \nyou untie it does a person emerge from the sack. In an oddly jovial manner for someone who \nhad clearly been kidnapped, the stranger greets you, \“Hello! The name is (NOBILITY NAME). I \ncan’t thank you enough for saving me from my captor. He seemed very interested in my \namulet… and my cart for that matter. I can tell you’ve been traveling for while, you must be \ngoing to (TOWN NAME 2). Let me take you the rest of the way. I won’t take no for an answer.\”\n\t1: Yes\n\t2: Yes\n\t3: Yes",
    "\n\nAfter a few hours of riding you arrive at (TOWN NAME 2). \“Well, here we are. The \nride was a pleasure. You don’t owe me anything for the ride in fact keep the amulet and take \n100 gold. I will ask if you want to purchase any of what are actually my wares, not \nthat brute who previously tried to sell you my things.\”",
    "\n\nWhat would you like to do: \n\t1: Shop\n\t2:Leave for town",
    "\n\n\“I wish you the best of luck in all of your endeavors! Also be careful, a massive dragon has \nbeen terrorizing this town recently, there’s no telling when it could come back.\” They ride away \ninto town leaving you amulet in hand, preparing yourself to potentially fight the dragon and finish \nthe quest you’ve undertaken.",
    "\n\nYou enter through what remained of the west gate of the town. You are happy to be on the \npaved ground rather than the dirt roads. As you walk into town you try to compare what you’ve \nheard about this town with what you see. The bakery that produced the pastries that you so \nenjoyed when your father would bring them back from visiting the city, is nothing but a charred \nshell of a building that can barely read (BAKERY NAME). The afamed town hall is still in blazes \nand citizens are trying their best to quell the flames. You notice that the courier’s outpost that \nyou need to visit is burned but more intact than most buildings in the area.",
    "\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Head to the courier’s outpost\n\t2: Assist the citizens with the fire\n\t3: Investigate the bakery",
    "\n\nAmidst the rubble you find a charred note, you can’t make out most of the note but you can still \nread some of it.\n\“About your previous request, should you want anymore information, give the beggar north of \ntown 27 gold. He knows more than you would think.\”",
    "\n\nAs you approach the scene a woman runs up to you and shouts \“Please help! Someone is \nstill inside the town hall!\”\n\t1: Help\n\t2: Go to courier's outpost",
    "\n\nThe woman quickly runs off to try to find someone else to help as you make \nyour way to the courier’s outpost",
    "\n\nYou run into the town hall and notice that debris is falling quickly from the \nceiling and see that someone is trapped underneath a large beam. Running over to them \nyou see that they’re unconscious. You try to move the beam and it only moves slightly. \nYou realize that if you stay for much longer that you’ll face the same fate.\n\t1: Attempt to move the beam (chance)\n\t2: Run out of the building",
    "\n\nYou shove the beam off of the unconscious individual and carry them out of the \nbuilding. The woman who asked for your help rushes over to see if everything is ok. \nThey shake the person awake and coughing up ash the person comes to. Once they \nhave time to compose themselves they address you, \“The name is (NOBILITY NAME), \nthank you for savin....COUGH COUGH\” After a violent fit of coughing they continue. \n\“Thank you for saving me. I was trying to search the rest of the building when that beam \nfell on me./” The victim of the fire walked away leaning on the concerned woman. You \nthen make your way to the courier’s outpost to continue your quest.",
    "\n\nWith a large shove you manage to move the beam but not \nenough to retrieve the person. The heat and smoke is starting to get to you.",
    "\n\nYou decide that you won't be able to save the person in time and run out \nof the building. You explain to the woman that there was nothing that you could do and \nthen you make your way to the courier’s outpost.",
    "\n\nAs you walk in you notice that there are several holes in the roof caused by debris \nfrom the neighboring buildings. You’re surprised that this building didn’t take as much damage. \nYou see a frustrated man sweeping up the ash and debris on the floor. You approach him.\n\n\"What do you want? Can't you tell I'm busy?\"\n\t1: Ask about what happened\n\t2: Show him the bounty letter",
    "\n\n\”The dragon tore through town again. It barely gave us any time to recover since \nthe last attack. The beast took a pretty nasty gash to its side when it collided with the town hall. \nHopefully that will give us time to prepare for the next attack. We really need someone to handle \nthis monster.\”",
    "\n\n\“Fantastic. I’m glad to see that someone finally accepted that bounty. The \ndragon makes its nest in a cave near the top of (MOUNTAIN NAME) mountain. Its attacks have \nbeen getting more often. If we don’t handle this problem soon, this town will be totally destroyed. \nI’ve been told to give you this.\”",
    "\n\n\“You should leave by the gate north of town, or at least whatever’s left of it. There is a shop \nright next to it that you can re-equip at before you leave. Good Luck.\”",
    "\n\nThe man sees you out of the outpost and resumes his task of cleaning. You begin to head for \nthe north gate of town.",
    "\n\nAs you’re walking on your way to the north gate amidst the remains of many buildings, you \nhear the sound of clinking mail behind you. As you turn to face the sound, a man runs into you \nand shoves you to the ground. Rolling to see where the perpetrator went you see him run to the \nside of one of the buildings, gold coins falling from a sack he’s carrying. When he gets to the \nside of the building he jumps into a hole in the ground. Presumably into the sewers.",
    "\n\nJust after this you feel someone pull you up by the back of your armor and stand you up. \nSeveral town guards are now before you.\n\n\"Which way did the thief go?\" The urgency in their voice is clearly conveyed.\n\t1: I'm not sure.\n\t2: He jumped into the hole next to that building. If you hurry you can probably catch him.\n\t3: I'll handle it.",
    "\n\n\“Well tell us if you see him again, have a good day.\” Not totally pleased with yourself \nabout lying to the guards, you continue to the north gate of the city.",
    "\n\n\“Thank you for your help\”, \“come on men let’s go\”. The guards then jump into the same \nhole. Wishing there was more you could do to help, you continue to the north gate of the city.",
    "\n\nBefore the guards can stop you, you run and jump into the hole yourself. You land in what \nyou hope is ankle deep water but the vile smell would tell you otherwise. Still hearing the thief’s \nfootsteps, you pursue him further into the sewers.",
    "\n\nYou see the thief run through a doorway. You wonder to yourself why there is a door down here.\nNext to the door you can see a ladder that leads up to the surface.\n\nWhat would you like to do: \n\t1: Continue to run after the thief\n\t2: Sneak through the door after the thief\n\t3: Return to the surface",
    "\n\nYou climb up the ladder and return to the surface. You’ve gone a little out of your way but \nyou have no trouble finding your way to the north gate of town.",
    "\n\nYou run through the door and down a narrow hallway before bursting into a surprisingly \nlarge room filled with thieves. Unhappy to see someone unknown in their den they engage you.",
    "\n\nYou wait for a moment and then sneak in the door. After going down a narrow hallway you \nnotice that the hallway opens up into a large room. You can overhear the thieves talking.\n\n\"Some fool chased me down here but must have given up and left.\"\n\"Well how much did you score?\"\n\"300 gold plus some jewels.\"\n\"Good work. Put it in the treasury.\"\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\t1: Surprise attack the thieves\n\t2: Keep listening",
    "\n\nYou wait for a moment to hear all that there is to hear.\n\"Can you believe that the king is commissioning us to do this?\"\n\"Be quiet! We aren’t supposed to talk about that. You’re a dead man if I hear it again.\"\n\nSilence ensues. When you realize that no more information can be found out, you charge in and \nattack the shocked thieves.",
    "\n\nAfter defeating the thieves you are left alone in their den. There are two bordering rooms to \nthe larger one. You hear a cry for help from the room on the right.",
    "\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Investigate the left room\n\t2: Investigate the right room\n\t3: Go back and return to the surface",
    "\n\nYou walk to the left room and notice that it is locked and won’t budge. Fortunately it \nappears that the bag the thief was carrying is still on the ground outside. You take the bag and \nfind 300 gold and jewels.",
    "\n\nYou go into the right room which appears to be some kind of dungeon. You find that two \npeople are bound and gagged in a cell in the back of the room. You rush over to untie them, \nluckily the cell is unlocked. After untying them and removing the gags they stand up and thank you.\n\n\"Thank you so much. When we were kidnapped from our home we thought we’d never see the \nlight of day again.\”\n\"Our names are (NAME) and (NAME), unfortunately there is nothing we can give you now to reward you for your service.\”\n\nYou tell them how to get back to the surface and return to the main room.",
    "\n\nYou return to the surface and continue heading for the north gate of town.",
    "\n\nUpon reaching the north gate, you see the shop that the man mentioned as well as a beggar \non the side of the path.",
    "\n\nWhat would you like to do:\n\t1: Approach the beggar\n\t2: Go into the store\n\t3: Leave town",
    "\n\nAs you approach he addresses you. \“Hello kind soul, my name is (Name), I was part of the \nKing’s guard in my day but I’ve since lost my vision, could you spare some gold?\”\n\nHow much would you like to give the beggar? ",
    "\n\nA woman standing at the counter greets you, \"Hello what do you need?\"",

    "\n\nYou leave the store and return to the north gate",
    "\n\n You leave the town through the north gate and continue on your quest to slay the dragon. \nThe mountain is only about a day’s journey so you are mentally preparing yourself to fight the dragon.",
